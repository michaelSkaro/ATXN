# ATXN

###### Just started working on this chapter. Most of the depositied code is from preliminary data preprocessing and short R scripts for exploratory analysis. 

### Investigating the pleiotropc effects of systemic increased levels of circulating autotaxin. This repository is the code base for the analyzing murine transcriptomics and small non-coding RNA sequencing samples

### Outline:
### [Transcriptomics] 
### [Variantion and Cancer Genetics](https://github.com/michaelSkaro/ATXN/tree/main/DataPreprocessing/variant_calling).
  
[X] Portable conda environment 
[-] Clean up into snakemake incoming 
[-] Pull from config and yml

```
./set_up_conda.sh
```
  
[X] Make the directories
[X] Align,call variants gatk. 
[-] Formalize with snakemake
  
```
./variant_calling_gatk.sh
```
[X] Make the directories
[X] Annotate using Functotator: gatk. 
[-] Formalize with snakemake
