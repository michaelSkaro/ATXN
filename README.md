# ATXN

###### Just started working on this chapter. Most of the depositied code is from preliminary data preprocessing and short R scripts for exploratory analysis. 

### Investigating the pleiotropc effects of systemic increased levels of circulating autotaxin. This repository is the code base for the analyzing murine transcriptomics and small non-coding RNA sequencing samples
